		'    The world is vast, and even the keen eye of an Elven being cannot comprehend all its vastness. ' ..
		'But there is an art that opens the way to see beyond the visible and know the hidden. ' ..
		'This art is based on the deep secrets passed down to us by the Valar and the higher powers of Arda, ' ..
		'but at the same time requires an inquisitive spirit and a thirst for knowledge to create an Eye, ' ..
		'through which one can know both the past and the future. ' ..
		'Let these pages serve as a guide to understanding how to forge light and darkness in stone, ' ..
		'which will open to you worlds beyond the tangible.\\\n' ..

		'    The palantiri are the greatest of Middle-earth\'s devices, ' ..
		'allowing one to travel vast distances ' ..
		'in the blink of an eye. Travel occurs between ' ..
		'altars with installed Palantiri.\\\n' ..
		'\\\n' ..
		'    To create an altar with a Palantir, you need to prepare the following materials:\\\n' ..
		'        - Palantir\\\n' ..
		'        - At least 8 Tilkal blocks\\\n' ..
		'        - At least 16 Mithril blocks\\\n' ..
		'\\\n' ..
		'    Before creating the altar, decide on a location. ' ..
		'Once installed, the Tilkal blocks cannot be ' ..
		'destroyed or moved.\\\n' ..
		'\\\n' ..
		'    Place at least 8 Tilkal blocks and at least ' ..
		'16 Mithril blocks so that they are no further than ' ..
		'two meters from the Palantir\'s location ' ..
		'(a 5x5x5 meter zone with the Palantir in the center). ' ..
		'In addition to these materials, you can use other materials. ' ..
		'The Palantir must be freely accessible from different sides for movement to it. ' ..
		'If there is not enough space, moving to this Palantir will be impossible.\\\n' ..
		'\\\n' ..
		'    After creating the altar and installing the Palantir, you need to ' ..
		'contact the Palantir (RMB) and determine the ' ..
		'name of the clan to which this ' ..
		'Palantir will belong. You need to specify the name of this Palantir in this ' ..
		'clan. You cannot attach your Palantir to ' ..
		'another clan or name two Palantiras in one clan the same.\\\n' ..
		'\\\n' ..
		'    Next, you need to select the races that will be allowed to ' ..
		'move in this Palantir clan. Those who ' ..
		'try to break the ban will be very unlucky. ' ..
		'If you prohibit movement for all races, only the owner of this clan will be able to move between ' ..
		'Palantirs.\\\n' ..
		'\\\n' ..
		'    After installing the second and subsequent Palantirs, ' ..
		'you need to visit all the remaining Palantirs in the clan and ' ..
		'tap them to update them (LMB).\\\n' ..
		'    To reconfigure the Palantir, you need to remove some of the ' ..
		'mithril blocks until their number becomes ' ..
		'less than 16 pcs.\\\n' ..
		'    Next, you need to try to move to another ' ..
		'Palantir or select the first line in the movement list. ' ..
		'The Palantir will disconnect from the clan and the altar - you can ' ..
		'restore the altar and install the Palantir again.'
